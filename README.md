### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">, my name is Renars Varslavans!

I'm a Java developer, comfortable working with Spring Boot and plain Java. My other technologies are listed in the **toolbox** below!<br>
*My LinkedIn profile* - <https://www.linkedin.com/in/renars-varslavans/>

My Java coding skills have come from the Codelex bootcamp, but before that I was learning about HTML/CSS/JavaScript/Solidity on my own for 2 years!
At the moment I'm getting my formal education at EKA (Ekonomikas un kulturas augstskola) university in IT Engeneering (To finish 2026).

I've always liked programming and I'm eager to continue my development in Java and other programming-related technologies/languages.

**Below I have listed three of my projects:**

1.*NFT minting website and Solidity (Ethereum) smart Conctract*<br>
**Website** - <http://badassbaristas.com/>

 About the project:
 
 -The website is made in pure HTML and SCSS, using JavaScript to connect the SmartContract to the actual page and allowing anyone with a metamask wallet to mint the NFTs<br>
 -Smart contract created with Solidity in an online IDE remix. Using the most gas fee-friendly minting standard (ERC-721A). Deployed and verified using etherscan.io<br>
 -Minting functionallity integration was done using Walletconnect API that allows users to mint from a Desktop Pc or phone.<br>
 -For the NFT collection itself, coded a custom Python program to generate the images combining layers based on their weight and chance. Once created the metadata for the specific NFT with its unique traits is saved in separate folders. No two identical NFTs can be made.<br>
 -Metadata generation and saving is done following Opensea Metadata Standart to ensure the visibility and option to sell the NFT on their marketplace<br>
 -Metadata and Images are hosted using pinata.cloud, because there were 10,000 images generated with the total size of 10GB, they had to be uploaded with the Pinata API<br>
 -Website is hosted using hostgator.com<br>
